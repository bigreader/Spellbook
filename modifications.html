                    <p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level.</p>

                    <p>Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.</p>
                    <p>If the effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for the full duration.</p>
                    <p>If you have used the Tides of Chaos feature and have not yet finished a long rest, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of the feature.</p>
